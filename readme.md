# NPCI MLOps Playground Challenge - 2

Dockerizing Bike Rental Count Prediction model.

---

## Objective
Participants are required to:
1. Create an `app.py` file that leverages [Gradio](https://gradio.app/) to create a user-friendly UI for a pre-trained bike rent count prediction model.
2. Dockerize the application for easy deployment and portability.

## Repository Structure

```
├── random_forest_model.pkl         # Pre-trained bike rent prediction model (provided)
├── README.md         # Instructions and details (this file)
└── requirements.txt  # Dependencies for the project
└── bike_rental_count_prediction.ipynb  # Python notebook(contains model training)
``````

---

## Instructions

 - Utilize Visual Studio Code (VS Code) on your local system or set up Codespaces as your development environment.

- Prepare individually in advance to understand the task and gather necessary resources.

- Work collaboratively with your team members in assigned Zoom breakout rooms. (The team will be the same as grouped for playground challenge 1)

- Reach out to the instructor if you have any questions or encounter difficulties.

- Present your team’s solution to the instructor once completed.

## Steps to complete: 

### Step 1: Understand the model 
1. Understand the  bike_rental_count_prediction notebook


### Step 2: Implement the Gradio UI (`app.py`)
1. Create an `app.py` file in the root directory.
2. In `app.py`, load the `random_forest_model.pkl` file and implement the prediction logic.
3. Use Gradio to build a UI for users to input the necessary features for bike rent prediction.
4. Example workflow for `app.py`:
   - Load the `random_forest_model.pkl`.
   - Define a prediction function.
   - Use Gradio to create the UI.

### Step 3: Update Dependencies in requirements.txt



### Step 4: Dockerize the Application
 Create a `Dockerfile` in the root directory.


### Step 5: Build and Run the Docker Container
1. Build the Docker image
2. Run the Docker container
